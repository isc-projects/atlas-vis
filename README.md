Root System Visualiser
======================

This is the source code for https://atlas-vis.isc.org/ - a tool
to look at the catchment area of Root Server system instances.

If you wish to deploy your own instance no back end code is needed.
The application runs entirely in the browser from static HTML and JavaScript content.
